This is a little application written in Grails that accompanies my blog post about Named Queries with Projections in Grails.

"I was watching the first series of Battlestar Galactica (I know I know, Iâ€™m WAY behind!). During the second episode the fleet runs into a water shortage and they resort to seeking for water on nearby planets. Imagine if they had Grails! They would be able to write a named query, and locate a moon or planet with water in no time!"

This project is home to the BSG universe that we will traverse so that we can get find waterbaring bodies in space!

You can find the Spock Specs (hey, wait a minute! wrong series!) in the test/integration folder.
